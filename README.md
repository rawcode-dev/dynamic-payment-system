# ðŸ’³ Dynamic Payment System - MVP 2

A Spring Boot backend project demonstrating **Strategy Design Pattern** in a realistic, extensible payment system. This is the **MVP 2 (Minimum Viable Product)** version of the system, where different payment methods are supported via request-specific DTOs and mapped to their respective strategies in a type-safe, production-style architecture.

## ðŸš€ MVP 2 Features

âœ… Process payments through multiple payment methods  
âœ… Handles payment logic based on dynamic strategy resolution  
âœ… Uses DTO-specific strategies (e.g., Credit Card, UPI, PayPal)  
âœ… Clean architecture, pluggable strategies  
âœ… Built with extensibility and real-world design patterns

## ðŸ§  Design Patterns Used

### ðŸ§© Strategy Design Pattern
Each payment method has its own `PaymentStrategy<T extends PaymentRequestDto>`, making logic for each method isolated and extensible.

### ðŸ§° Registry-Based Strategy Lookup
A custom `PaymentStrategyRegistry` maps each DTO type (e.g., `CreditCardRequestDto`) to its strategy, avoiding casting and maintaining type safety.
